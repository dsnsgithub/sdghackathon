# Coding for SDG 2023 Hackathon Submission

## Topic: UN SDG #13 (Climate Action) 

## Intro: 
One part of reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the air is to recycle correctly.
Less plastic created = less oil burned = better for the enviroment.

Recycling not only helps CO2 emissions, it also improves the cleanliness of the enviroment around us.
Who doesn't want that?

According to (https://www.americanprogress.org/article/energy-from-waste-can-help-curb-greenhouse-gas-emissions/):
> Recycling and composting reduces trash that is destined for the landfill that would have emitted greenhouse gases while decomposing, saves energy that would have been used for the production of a virgin material, and decreases the need to mine for raw materials, which will preserve our natural resources.

## How My Submission Will Help:
Many items that could have been recycled are thrown in the trash, mainly due to a lack of awareness/understanding about what is/what isn't recyclable.

My solution is to create a fun game that helps inform people what should be recycled and what shouldn't, making it easier for the recycling companies to process/reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
